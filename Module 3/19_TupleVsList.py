# 19. What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.

# In programming languages, such as Lisp, Python, Linda, and others, a tuple (pronounced TUH-pul) is an ordered set of values. The separator for each value is often a comma 

# Difference:
# They are both used to store collection of data
# They are both heterogeneous data types means that you can store any kind of data type
# They are both ordered means the order in which you put the items are kept.
# They are both sequential data types so you can iterate over the items contained.
# Items of both types can be accessed by an integer index operator, provided in square brackets, [index]
# The key difference between the tuples and lists is that while the tuples are immutable objects the lists are mutable. This means that tuples cannot be changed while the lists can be modified. Tuples are more memory efficient than the lists.
